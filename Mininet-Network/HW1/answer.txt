Q2:
•	Expected Latency: 140 ms
•	Expected Throughput: ~ 8 Mbps
•	Average Latency: 140 ms
•	Average Throughput: ~ 6.675 Mbps

The prediction is correct since the average latency is the sum of all latency in the path,
and the throughput is limited by the slowest link.

Q3:
TWO PAIRS:
•	Expected Latency: ~140 ms
•	Expected Throughput: ~ 10Mbps
•	Average Latency: ~140.4 ms 
•	Average Throughput: ~ 9.6Mbps (~10.4Mpbs & ~8.8Mpbs)
THREE PAIRS:
•	Expected Latency: ~141 ms
•	Expected Throughput: ~ 6.8Mbps
•	Average Latency: ~140.5 ms 
•	Average Throughput: ~ 6.72Mbps (~10.4Mpbs & ~5.04Mpbs & ~4.8Mpbs)

The prediction is correct since the average latency of each pair roughly equals the sum of latency
in each's path and the throughput is allocated for all the pairs. 
Thus the average of the thoughput for each pair is the slowest link divided by the number of pairs.
In reality, the throughput may not be equally divided.

Q4: 
H5-H6:
•	Expected Latency: ~80 ms
•	Expected Throughput: ~ 12Mbps
•	Average Latency: ~81 ms 
•	Average Throughput: ~ 11.666Mbps 
H1-H4:
•	Expected Latency: ~141 ms
•	Expected Throughput: ~ 8Mbps
•	Average Latency: ~140.5 ms 
•	Average Throughput: ~ 6.427Mbps 

The prediction is correct since the latency of each pair is the sum of all latency in the path,
and the throughput is limited by the slowest link
